# IMDb Movie Rating Prediction
This project predicts movie ratings based on various features such as votes, duration, and genre using multiple regression models.

- Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Steps:
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

1. Handling missing values and data type conversion.
Feature extraction and encoding (e.g., Genres, Directors, and Actors).
Data Visualization:

2. Visualizations of movie genre distribution, rating vs. duration, and movie duration.

### Model Building:

- Regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest.
Performance metrics: R², MSE, RMSE, MAE.
Results:

- Random Forest Regression outperforms other models with the highest R² score (0.90).
